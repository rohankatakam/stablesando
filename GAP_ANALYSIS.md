# Gap Analysis: Current Implementation vs. Requirements

## Executive Summary

**Status**: 🟡 **85% Complete** - Core functionality working, missing fee engine

### Critical Gaps
1. ❌ **Fee Engine**: Not implemented
2. ❌ **Fee information in responses**: Missing from API and webhooks
3. ⚠️ **Production scaling documentation**: Incomplete

### Implementation Status by Requirement

---

## 1. REST API Endpoints ✅ COMPLETE

### POST /payments
- ✅ Accepts payment requests
- ✅ Required fields validated (amount, currency, source/destination accounts)
- ✅ Returns 202 Accepted with payment_id
- ✅ Idempotency-Key header required and validated
- ✅ Proper error responses (400, 409)

**Status**: Fully implemented and tested

**Evidence**:
- API handler: `cmd/api-handler/main.go`
- Validator: `internal/validator/validator.go`
- Live endpoint: `https://np11urdqn4.execute-api.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/dev/payments`

---

## 2. Fee Engine ❌ MISSING - CRITICAL GAP

### Current State
- **No fee calculation logic implemented**
- Fees not stored in payment records
- Fees not returned in API responses
- Fees not included in webhook payloads

### Required Implementation

**Need to create**: `internal/fees/calculator.go`

```go
type FeeCalculator struct {
    // Fee structure configuration
}

type FeeResult struct {
    FeeAmount    int64   // Fee in USD cents
    FeeCurrency  string  // "USD"
    FeeRate      float64 // Effective rate used
    BaseAmount   int64   // Original amount
}

func (f *FeeCalculator) CalculateFee(amount int64, currency string) *FeeResult
```

**Fee Structure to Implement (MVP)**:
```
Amount < $100 (10,000 cents):     2.9% + $0.30
Amount < $1000 (100,000 cents):   2.5% + $0.50
Amount >= $1000:                   2.0% + $1.00
```

### Required Changes

1. **Add fees to Payment model** (`internal/models/payment.go`):
```go
type Payment struct {
    // ... existing fields ...
    FeeAmount   int64  `json:"fee_amount"`
    FeeCurrency string `json:"fee_currency"`
}
```

2. **Update API handler** (`cmd/api-handler/main.go`):
   - Calculate fee before storing payment
   - Include fee in response (optional)

3. **Update worker handler** (`cmd/worker-handler/main.go`):
   - Include fee in webhook payload

4. **Update DynamoDB table** (Terraform):
   - Add fee_amount and fee_currency attributes

**Priority**: 🔴 **HIGH** - This is explicitly required in the assignment

## 3. Mock Integrations ✅ COMPLETE

### Onramp Provider (USD → USDC)
- ✅ Mock implementation exists
- ✅ Simulates latency (100-200ms)
- ✅ Returns transaction ID
- ✅ 5% random failure for testing
- ✅ Proper logging

**Location**: `internal/payment/orchestrator.go:102-135`

### Offramp Provider (USDC → EUR)
- ✅ Mock implementation exists
- ✅ Simulates latency (100-200ms)
- ✅ Returns transaction ID
- ✅ 5% random failure for testing
- ✅ Proper logging

**Location**: `internal/payment/orchestrator.go:137-170`

**Status**: Fully implemented

**Minor Issue**: Currently uses 1:1 conversion ratio. Should add comment explaining this is intentional for MVP.

---

## 4. Idempotency ✅ COMPLETE

- ✅ Idempotency-Key header required
- ✅ Validated at API level
- ✅ Stored with payment record
- ✅ DynamoDB GSI on idempotency_key for fast lookups
- ✅ Returns 409 Conflict on duplicate
- ✅ Tested and working

**Status**: Fully implemented and tested

**Evidence**:
- Validator: `internal/validator/validator.go`
- Database: `internal/database/dynamodb.go`
- DynamoDB index: `idempotency-key-index`
- Test result: Duplicate request correctly rejected with 409

---

## 5. Async Event Handling ✅ COMPLETE

### Queue-Based Processing
- ✅ Payment acceptance decoupled from processing
- ✅ SQS queue for payment jobs
- ✅ Separate SQS queue for webhooks
- ✅ Dead Letter Queues (DLQs) for failed messages
- ✅ Lambda event source mappings configured

### Webhook System
- ✅ Webhook handler Lambda implemented
- ✅ Processes webhook queue
- ✅ Mock webhook delivery (logs to CloudWatch)

**Status**: Architecture complete

**Gap**: Webhook payload missing fee information
```json
// Current webhook (missing fees):
{
  "event_type": "payment.completed",
  "payment_id": "uuid",
  "status": "COMPLETED",
  // ❌ Missing fees object
}

// Required webhook:
{
  "event_type": "payment.completed",
  "payment_id": "uuid",
  "status": "COMPLETED",
  "fees": {
    "amount": 2900,
    "currency": "USD"
  }
}
```

---

## 6. Data Model ⚠️ MOSTLY COMPLETE

### Current Payment Schema
```
✅ payment_id (PK)
✅ idempotency_key (GSI)
✅ status (PENDING, PROCESSING, COMPLETED, FAILED)
✅ amount
✅ currency
✅ source_account
✅ destination_account
❌ fees (NOT STORED) ← CRITICAL GAP
✅ on_ramp_tx_id
✅ off_ramp_tx_id
✅ created_at
✅ updated_at
✅ processed_at
```

**Missing**: Fee amount and currency fields

---

## Risk Assessment

### Current Risks

1. **Missing Fee Engine** 🔴 HIGH RISK
   - This is explicitly required in the assignment
   - Shows understanding of payment processing costs
   - Should be implemented before submission

2. **Incomplete Scaling Documentation** 🟡 MEDIUM RISK
   - One of the evaluation criteria
   - Current docs touch on it but not comprehensive
   - Easy to fix with a dedicated document

### Overall Risk Level: 🟡 MEDIUM

**Mitigation**: Implementing the fee engine (1 hour) reduces risk to 🟢 LOW

---

## Estimated Time to Complete Critical Gaps

- **Fee Engine Implementation**: 45 minutes
- **Infrastructure Update**: 15 minutes
- **Documentation Update**: 15 minutes
- **Testing**: 15 minutes

**Total**: ~90 minutes to achieve 100% completion

## Recommendation

**Next Steps**:
1. Implement fee engine (highest priority)
2. Update infrastructure to store fees
3. Test end-to-end with fees
4. Create production scaling document
5. Final review and polish
6. Submit to GitHub
7. Book presentation call

**Current Status**: Strong foundation, one critical gap. With fee engine implemented, this will be an excellent submission demonstrating all required competencies.
